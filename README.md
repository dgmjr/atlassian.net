# Atlassian.NET

An attempt to create a comprehensive (or as close as possible) set of .NET APIs for connecting to, reading from, writing to, and managing Atlassian products and content.  Because I recently had to do this for work and **there weren't any**!!!

Stay tuned for first code upload as I rework things to be a redistributable and self-enclosed library and also improve on the very basic functionality I completed.

## Note:
This project is dormand due to lack of demand as well as my attention being drawn to other more potentialy popular projects.
Little to no code is published because I am attempting to complete a v0.1 release before making the code public.
